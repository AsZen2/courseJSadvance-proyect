                        <h2>The biggining of the history of programming</h2>
                        <p>
                            The first lenguage programming was a algorithm creating by Ada Lovelace in 1883.
                            <br>
                            Ada Lovelace created this algorithm to Charles Babbage's analytical motor.
                            <br>
                            The propose of this algorithm was to calculate numbers of Bernoulli.
                            <br>
                            In 1936, for the first time, computer codes were specialized by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing.
                            <br>
                            Church expressed lambda calculus in a formulaic form.

                        <h2>Assembly language</h2>

                        <p> The first modern (electrically powered) computers were created in the 1940s. These computers were limited in speed and memory capacity.
                            Because of these limitations, programmers were forced to manually write programs in assembly language. Being a low-level programming language, it was a difficult task to program manually. Programmers then realized the need for high-level languages ​​to lessen the effort required to write assembly language programs manually.    </p>

                        <h2>The first programming languages</h2>
                        <p>Formulatranslation is the oldest programming language still in use. Created by John Backus in 1957, this tool was developed for high-level scientific computing, mathematics and statistics.
                            Today, this language is still used in the automotive, aerospace, government and research industries. For example, it is very useful for forecasting weather services.
                            
                            In 1959, Cobol was developed, which is behind most business transaction systems for credit card processing, ATMs (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), telephony, hospital systems, government, automated systems and traffic signals.
                            The development of Cobol, created by Grace Murray Hopper, shows a familiar and uniform language for business transactions. For example, it is used in the US Postal Service.
                            
                            In 1964, Basic was created, which was designed as a simplified language for those who did not have a strong technical or mathematical background.
                            
                            Between 1969 and 1973, C was created by Dennis Ritchie for Bell Telephone Laboratories for use in the Unix system. It was called "C" because its features were derived from an earlier language called "B."
                            
                            At Bells Laboratories, Bjarne Stroustrup modified the C language into C++, creating what many consider to be the most popular programming language ever. It has also been listed in the top ten programming languages ​​since 1986 and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2003. Today it is used by Firefox, Office, and Adobe PDF Reader
                            This kick-started the further refinement of languages ​​until they became the languages ​​we have today.</p>
